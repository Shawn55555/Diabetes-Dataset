# Diabetes-Dataset
This is a school project which look at several factors correlated with a person having diabetes. In this project we concluded that a logistic regression model using glm was better than a linear model. Subsequently we selected the best model, through BIC, AIC ,cross validation and lasso shrinkage approach.In the models we created, we felt that model with the lowest false negative rate.
